By leveraging CompletableFuture for parallel REST calls, I optimized API performance, reducing latency by 40%. I ensured data integrity and optimal performance using both SQL and NoSQL databases while employing OpenAPI standards to generate service integration classes and interfaces. My contributions included achieving up to 100% test coverage on RESTful APIs with JUnit and utilizing Pactflow and Hoverfly for integration and component testing, ensuring seamless service communication. Additionally, I conducted knowledge transfer sessions, provided debugging support, and facilitated code reviews, actively participating in technical discussions with clients. I collaborated closely with the Product Owner to refine Jira stories, improving sprint planning and reducing cycle time. Through structured documentation, I streamlined onboarding, significantly reducing ramp-up time for new team members, while also supporting cross-functional teams with technical insights and knowledge sharing.",
